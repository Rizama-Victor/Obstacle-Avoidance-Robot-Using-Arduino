## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and development of an obstacle-avoidance robot using Arduino. The robot was programmed to detect and avoid obstacles autonomously using an ultrasonic distance sensor that measures the proximity of 
surrounding objects. When an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, the Arduino microcontroller processes the input and triggers a change in the robot’s motion: stopping, turning, or rerouting to prevent collision.
